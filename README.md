### Feature files

A feature file is a [Business Readable, Domain Specific Language](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html) file that lets you describe softwareâ€™s behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented. Feature files are written using the [Gherkin syntax](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) and must live in a folder named **features** within the root of your project.

```gherkin
task.feature

@task
